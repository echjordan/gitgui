# Git It Done

A Git GUI that visualizes git repositories as directed acyclic graphs. Built using [Nodegit](http://www.nodegit.org/) and [SimpleGit](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js) to handle git backend, and [React Graph Vis](https://github.com/crubier/react-graph-vis) to visualize graphs. Built on top of [electron-react-redux-boilerplate](https://github.com/jschr/electron-react-redux-boilerplate).

Functionality includes:

* Select a local repository and render its commits as a graph to visualize workflow.
* Select a commit node and see when it was made and by which contributor.
* Make commits and have the graph update in realtime.
* Keep track of local and remote branches and git status.
* Pull and push to GitHub.
* Merge branches.
* Clone repositories.
* Checkout and add and delete branches.
* Stash and fetch.
